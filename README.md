# ELE-548 Final Project: AI Deployment Environments and Requirements

AI Deployment Environments and Requirements for ELE-548

This project was tasked with creating and evaluating a set of quantatative metrics for determining the best deployment platform for a Deep Neural Network (DNN) on a varied set of hardware platforms.

Five major implementations were evaluated for this project, including:
1) A Xilinx FPGA development board

    1a) A simple software based implementation running on the ARM cores present on the SoC
    
    1b) A software implementation that utilizes a custom hardware-based accelerator implemented on the FPGA logic
    
2) A Raspberry Pi
3) A Windows-based Desktop Computer

    3a) Software based implementation running on the local x86-64 CPU
    
    3b) Software based implementation that utilizes a local GPU based DNN accelerator
    

The implementations for each platform can be found in the respective sub-folder of this project.

The Deliverables sub-folder contains all submissions related to this project, and includes:
