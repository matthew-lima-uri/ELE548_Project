# ELE-548 Final Project: Windows implementation

NN_Training.py: Trains the DNN model and saves it as mnist.h5\n
NN_Evaluation.py: Evaluates the trained mnist.h5 model\n
NN_TFLite_Conversion: Converts the trained mnist.h5 model to a TFLite model. Saves the TFLite model as mnist_quant.tflite\n
NN_Numpy_Array_Test.py: Evaluates the weights and biases generated by Netron by running the matrix operatings on the dataset and checking its accuracy.\n
NN_Convert_To_C.py: Converts the numpy arrays to a C header file containing the weights and biases as const arrays. The C header file is named arrays.h\n
